# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

# Medium

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
</pre>

Example 3:

<pre>
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
</pre>

Constraints:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
