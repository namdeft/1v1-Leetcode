# 409. Longest Palindrome

# Easy

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
</pre>

Constraints:

-   `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
-   `s` consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.
