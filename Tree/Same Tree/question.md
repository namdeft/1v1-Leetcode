# 100. Same Tree

# Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
</pre>

Example 3:

<pre>
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
</pre>

Constraints:

-   The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
-   `104 <= Node.val <= 104`
